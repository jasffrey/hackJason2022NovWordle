WORDLE SOLVER

Instructions:
-Edit WordleGame.java by updating lines 14 and 20
-Create your own method(s) or class(es) to implement your wordle solver

*Sample csv file is provided to you for you to test your code
*You may not use any pre-exiting wordle word bank but you may incorporate / 
 develop your own word banks (using dictionaries or other resources)
*You may not use pre-existing code

Scoring Criteria (all scores are evenly weighted)
1. Number of Wordles (Games) successfully solved
2. Average round to solve Wordle overall (failed game attempts = 5 rounds maximum penalty)
3. Program runtime to check your code efficiency

All individual scores will be calibrated based on highest score in that criterion
e.g. player 1 = 100 points, player 2 = 88 points, and player 3 = 23 points
player 1 = 100 / 100 = 1
player 2 = 88 / 100 = 0.88
player 3 = 23 / 100 = 0.23
